**Key things to customize/check in this README before you commit:**

1.  **`<your_repository_url>`**: If you put this on GitHub, replace this placeholder.
2.  **Docker Image Name**: I've used `vggt-colmap-processor` as per your last request. If you decide on a different name during the `docker build -t <name> .` step, update the README and the `process_video_with_vggt_docker.sh` script.
3.  **Prerequisites**: Add any other specific prerequisites for your environment if necessary.
4.  **Troubleshooting**: Add any common issues you encounter and their solutions.

This README should give users a good starting point for understanding and using your project.
